        Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science graduate from FSHMN with a solid foundation in programming. My enthusiasm for front-end development led me to pursue additional courses in JavaScript and React, complementing my formal education. This blend of academic learning and self-driven study has equipped me with a strong skill set for creating dynamic and engaging web applications.
